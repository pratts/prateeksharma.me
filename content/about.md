## Hello, I'm Prateek Sharma!
I am a curious and passionate individual with an interest in backend development. I like exploring new technologies and learning new skills. 

I started my journy in September 2014 with an online gaming company named "Adda52" as a trainee. Since then, I have worked in startups in Transport, B2B SaaS industries with team sizes ranging from 4-40+. I learnt new languages and technologies like Java, Python, Node.js, Postgres, MongoDB, Redis, and more. I have also worked with AWS, Docker and Kubernetes to deploy and manage applications in production environments.

Below mentioned are some of the key projects that I was involved in during my career:
- **Emission Critical**: I led the development of a multi-tenant SaaS database schema and built a NestJS microservice architecture for a B2B product. I was also involved in writing the core logic to compure carbon emissions and product carbon footprints for various industries.
- **Mind Sports League**: I was involved in writing poker game and tournament features on top of the existing gaming platform. I also created a poker simulator in AngularJS to help players practice their skills and strategies.
- **Yolobus**: I was involved in designing the in-house bus ticket booking system, which included the database design, API development and integration with third-party services like Redbus and Paytm.
- **Adda52**: I was involved in designing a disaster recovery plan for the gaming platform, which included restoring the poker games and player data in case of a failure.

Some of the personal projects I am currently working on include:
- **[prateeksharma.me](https://pratts.github.io)**: A website where I share my learnings as a backend developer.
- **[Tidylnk.com](https://admin.tidylnk.com/)**: A URL shortener service that I built using Golang, React, Redis and PostgreSQL. The services are deployed using Docker and Railway.
- **Proxy + Adblocker**: A proxy server that I built using Golang, which blocks ads domains as well.
- **Video Translator**: A tool that I built using Python and OpenAI's APIs to translate videos into different languages and generate subtitles.

Primary technologies I have worked on include:
- **Programming Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, Golang
- **Backend Frameworks:** Node.js, NestJS, Express.js, Python Django
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, MariaDB, Redis, Meilisearch
- **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS, AWS Chalice, Jenkins, Docker, Git, GitHub
- **Frontend Technologies:** Angular 2, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Development Methodologies:** Agile, Scrum, Test-Driven Development
- **Messaging & Queues:** RabbitMQ, NATS, Redis Pub/Sub
- **Authentication:** Auth0, JWT, OAuth
- **Specializations:** System Design, Database Optimization, API Development, Multi-tenant Architecture, Real-time Systems

Apart from my professional work, I read books and enjoy calisthenics in an academy. I believe that taking care of my physical health is as important as my mental health, and I try to maintain a balance between both.
